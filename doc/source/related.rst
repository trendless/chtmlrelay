======================

Active development takes place in the `chatmail/relay github repository <https://github.com/chatmail/relay>`_.

You can check out the `'chatmail' tag in the support.delta.chat forum <https://support.delta.chat/tag/chatmail>`_
and ask to get added to a non-public support chat for debugging issues.

We know of two work-in-progress alternative implementation efforts:

-  `Mox <https://github.com/mjl-/mox>`_: A Golang email server. `Work
   is in progress <https://github.com/mjl-/mox/issues/251>`_ to modify
   it to support all of the features and configuration settings required
   to operate as a chatmail relay.

-  `Maddy-Chatmail <https://github.com/sadraiiali/maddy_chatmail>`_: a
   plugin for the `Maddy email server <https://maddy.email/>`_ which
   aims to implement the chatmail relay features and configuration
   options.
