# Chatmail relays for end-to-end encrypted email

Chatmail relay servers are interoperable Mail Transport Agents (MTAs) designed for: 

-  **Zero State:** no private data or metadata collected, messages are auto-deleted, low disk usage

-  **Instant/Realtime:** sub-second message delivery, realtime P2P
   streaming, privacy-preserving Push Notifications for Apple, Google, and Huawei;

-  **Security Enforcement**: Only connections with strict TLS are accepted;
   all messages must be correctly signed with DKIM and OpenPGP-encrypted with minimized metadata.
   There are experimental exceptions for no-DNS relays,
   which are allowed use self-signed TLS certificates
   and which do not need to DKIM-sign their messages.
   Unencrypted messages are allowed in neither case.

-  **Reliable Federation and Decentralization:** No spam or IP reputation checks, federating
   depends on established IETF standards and protocols.

This repository contains everything needed to setup a ready-to-use chatmail relay on an ssh-reachable host.
