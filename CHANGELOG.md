## 1.6.0 2025-04-11

- Handle Port-25 connect errors more gracefully (common with VPNs)
  ([#552](https://github.com/chatmail/relay/pull/552))

  same timezone. 
  ([#553](https://github.com/chatmail/relay/pull/553))

- Enforce end-to-end encryption for incoming messages. 
  New user address mailboxes now get a `enforceE2EEincoming` file 
  which prohibits incoming cleartext messages from other domains. 
  An outside MTA trying to submit a cleartext message will 
  get a "523 Encryption Needed" response, see RFC5248. 
  If the file does not exist (as it the case for all existing accounts) 
  incoming cleartext messages are accepted. 
  ([#538](https://github.com/chatmail/server/pull/538))

- query autoritative nameserver to bypass DNS cache
  ([#424](https://github.com/chatmail/server/pull/424))

- add mtail support (new optional `mtail_address` ini value)
  This defines the address on which [`mtail`](https://google.github.io/mtail/)

  setup a private network (e.g. WireGuard interface)

  ([#438](https://github.com/chatmail/server/pull/438))


## 1.4.1 2024-07-31

  run `./scripts/initenv.sh` to upgrade locally.
  ([#378](https://github.com/chatmail/server/pull/378))

- don't hardcode "/home/vmail" paths but rather set them 
  once in the config object and use it everywhere else, 
  thereby also improving testability.  
  ([#351](https://github.com/chatmail/server/pull/351))
  temporarily introduced obligatory "passdb_path" and "mailboxes_dir" 
  settings but they were removed/obsoleted in

  ([#348](https://github.com/chatmail/server/pull/348))

  also introducing a generic mechanism for rapid remote ssh-based python function execution.
